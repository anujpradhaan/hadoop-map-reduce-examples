# hadoop-map-reduce-examples
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/hadoop-map-reduce-examples


This is a small project started at http://code.google.com/p/hadoop-map-reduce-examples/

I only exported here to have a better accessibility and will also conribute to it with some examples. Please use this or http://code.google.com/p/hadoop-map-reduce-examples/ repository to add your 
examples related to Hadoop


Here we have two directories

* Hadoop-examples :Default Directory added from the google code
* java : Java examples added by me to the repository. Not all the examples are created by me and I have written the sources and explaination of each code in the same file. I have given some hint only. I don't like giving complete solutions. They stop you from learning by yourself :)

I will also add map reduce codes for non-JVM langauges like python. I will add a separate folder with the PL name for all of them here.
